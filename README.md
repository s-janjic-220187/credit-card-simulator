# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Billing Cycle Simulator

A full-stack web application that simulates credit card billing cycles, interest, fees, and statement generation.  
Designed as a **profile-driven calculator**, this tool allows users to create multiple credit card profiles and observe how billing cycles, charges, and fees are calculated in various scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This application provides comprehensive credit card billing simulation with:

- **Billing Cycle Management**: Simulate monthly cycles with customizable dates
- **Interest Calculations**: APR-based daily interest computation
- **Fee Simulation**: Late fees, overlimit fees, foreign transaction fees
- **Statement Generation**: Detailed monthly statements with all charges
- **Profile-Based Testing**: Create multiple credit card profiles to compare scenarios
- **Educational Tool**: Understanding credit card mechanics and costs
