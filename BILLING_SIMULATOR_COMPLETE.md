## 🌟 Key Features Implemented

### 📈 Billing Cycle Management

```typescript
// Generate new billing cycle
POST /api/billing/cycle/:cardId

// View cycle history
GET /api/billing/cycles/:cardId

// Get detailed cycle info
GET /api/billing/cycle/:cycleId
```

### 💰 Advanced Calculations

```typescript
// Real-time interest calculation
GET /api/billing/calculate/interest/:cardId

// Fee structure analysis
GET /api/billing/calculate/fees/:cardId

// Minimum payment breakdown
GET /api/billing/calculate/minimum-payment/:cardId

// Payoff scenario modeling
GET /api/billing/calculate/payoff/:cardId
```

### 📋 Statement Generation

```typescript
// Generate detailed statements
POST /api/billing/statement/:cycleId

// Educational breakdowns included:
- Daily interest rate calculations
- Average daily balance methodology
- Fee application rules
- Minimum payment formula
```

## 🎓 Educational Components

### Interest Calculation Education

- **Daily Rate Formula**: APR ÷ 365 ÷ 100
- **Monthly Interest**: Daily Rate × Average Daily Balance × Days in Cycle
- **Compound Effect**: Visual representation of daily compounding

### Fee Structure Breakdown

- **Late Fees**: Percentage vs. flat fee (whichever is higher)
- **Overlimit Fees**: Applied when balance exceeds credit limit
- **Foreign Transaction Fees**: Percentage of international purchases
- **Cash Advance Fees**: Higher APR + upfront fee

### Payment Strategy Analysis

- **Minimum Payment Impact**: Long-term cost analysis
- **Payoff Scenarios**: Multiple payment amount comparisons
- **Interest Savings**: Visual representation of payment timing effects

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL + Prisma)

```sql
BillingCycle {
  - Tracks complete cycle from start to end
  - Calculates averageDailyBalance automatically
  - Records all charges, payments, fees
  - Links to detailed statements
}

CreditCard {
  - Enhanced with billing-specific fields
  - Configurable fee structures
  - Multiple APR types (purchase vs. cash advance)
  - Billing cycle customization
}

Statement {
  - Educational breakdowns included
  - Links to parent billing cycle
  - Detailed fee and interest reporting
}
```

### Billing Service Engine

```typescript
class BillingService {
  // Core calculation methods
  calculateDailyInterestRate(apr: number): number;
  calculateInterestCharge(balance: number, apr: number, days: number): number;
  calculateMinimumPayment(balance: number, fees: number): number;
  calculateAverageDailyBalance(
    cardId: string,
    start: Date,
    end: Date
  ): Promise<number>;

  // Advanced features
  generateBillingCycle(cardId: string): Promise<BillingCycle>;
  generateStatement(cycleId: string): Promise<Statement>;
}
```

## 📱 User Experience
